This project utilizes Airbnb Seattle rental property variables from 2016 to predict what types of variables best relate to whether or not a property allows for one night stays.  Logistic regression was utilized as the analytic method of choice.   It was found that the following variables were related to one night availability (with the category that results in more one night stays in parentheses):
-Number of reviews (more)
-Whether a host was a superhost or not (not)
-Whether hosts required a photo of guest or not (not)
-price of rental (lower)
-cancellation policy stringency (less stringent)
